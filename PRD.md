# Umang HIMS — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2026-05-22  
**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Umang Healthcare Group

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Umang HIMS is an AI-first, enterprise-grade Hospital Management System built for modern Indian hospitals. It unifies 24 role-based portals across every hospital function — clinical, operational, financial, support, and patient-facing — into a single web application. The platform embeds 31 AI-powered clinical decision-support services and a deterministic rules engine for patient safety, while meeting NABH accreditation standards and DISHA data-security requirements.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Indian hospitals — particularly secondary and tertiary-care facilities — operate on fragmented, department-siloed systems. Clinical decisions are delayed by manual handoffs. Bed management, OT scheduling, lab results, pharmacy dispensing, and billing happen in isolation. Staff spend significant time on paperwork that could be automated. Patients have zero visibility into their care journey. The resulting gaps lead to medical errors, revenue leakage, compliance risk, and poor patient experience.

Umang HIMS eliminates these gaps by providing a unified, real-time platform with AI-assisted workflows at every care touchpoint.

## 3. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide a single application covering the full patient lifecycle: OPD → IPD → OT → Discharge
- Embed clinical AI at the point of care for diagnosis support, prescriptions, triage, and risk scoring
- Give every department — billing, pharmacy, lab, radiology, blood bank, CSSD, dietary, BMW, mortuary, ambulance — a purpose-built portal
- Support NABH accreditation and DISHA compliance out of the box
- Deliver a bilingual UI (English + Hindi) for India-wide deployment
- Offer a patient self-service portal and public kiosk check-in

### Non-Goals (v1)
- Native mobile apps (iOS / Android)
- Integration with third-party HIS/LIS/PACS systems (API layer is a future phase)
- Billing to insurance payers directly (pre-auth workflow exists; EDI integration is future)
- Custom AI model training (all AI services use mock/LLM stubs swappable in production)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Requirements

### 7.1 Real-Time Notifications
`notification-dispatcher.ts` provides a centralised service for cross-department alerts:
- Critical lab value → nurse + treating doctor
- Sepsis alert → ER + ICU nurse
- OT pre-clearance failure → OT coordinator
- Discharge clearance bottleneck → billing + nurse

Store: `useNotificationStore`

### 7.2 Internationalisation
- English (`messages/en.json`) and Hindi (`messages/hi.json`) via `next-intl`
- Locale-aware routing via `src/i18n/routing.ts`
- Locale switching via server action `src/app/actions/locale.ts`

### 7.3 Security & Compliance
- **DISHA** (Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act) data handling
- **NABH** standard workflows: WHO checklist, incident reporting, quality indicators
- Role-based access enforced at the store layer (`useAuthStore` — role persists in Zustand)
- Audit trail: all significant actions written to `useAuditStore` with user ID, role, timestamp

### 7.4 Performance
- Next.js App Router with per-route streaming and server components where appropriate
- Client-side state via Zustand (no network round-trips for in-session data)
- Framer Motion animations use GPU-composited transforms only (no layout thrash)

### 7.5 Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation across role selector and portals
- Colour-coded severity indicators always paired with text labels (not colour-only)
- Mobile-responsive layouts (single-column on < lg, two-column on ≥ sm)

## 9. AI Integration Architecture

```
Clinical Event
      │
      ▼
Rules Engine (synchronous, deterministic)
  ├── BLOCK if hard constraint violated (allergy, dosage, OT gate)
  └── PASS → AI Service (async, probabilistic)
              ├── Returns: { result, confidence, reasoning }
              └── UI renders suggestion with confidence badge
                  └── Clinician accepts / modifies / overrides
                      └── Decision logged to Audit Store
```

All AI service functions follow the contract:
```typescript
type AiEnvelope<T> = {
  result: T
  confidence: number   // 0–1
  reasoning?: string
}
```

This design means AI is always advisory — the rules engine provides the hard safety net, AI provides probabilistic intelligence, and the clinician retains final authority.

## 10. Key User Flows

### OPD → IPD → OT → Discharge (Core Clinical Pathway)

```
Patient arrives at Reception
  → Token issued, joins OPD queue
  → Doctor receives AI pre-brief
  → Consultation → e-prescription with interaction check
  → Decision: Admit?
      Yes → Bed Manager allocates bed (AI forecast assists)
           → Nurse takes over ward care (MAR, vitals, rounds)
           → Labs / Radiology ordered → AI anomaly detection
           → OT scheduled → WHO checklist → AI surgical brief
           → Discharge initiated → 5-pillar clearance
           → AI discharge summary → Follow-up plan generated
           → Billing finalised → Insurance claim / TPA pre-auth
  → Patient Portal: tracks each stage in real time
```

### Emergency Pathway

```
Patient arrives at ER
  → Triage nurse enters vitals
  → Rules engine → ESI 1–5 (auto, < 2 seconds)
  → ESI 1–2: immediate physician alert + sepsis monitoring
  → Sepsis AI monitors every vitals update
  → Stabilised → transitions to IPD pathway above
```

---

## 13. Dependencies & Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| AI stubs not replaced with real LLMs | Clinical support remains non-functional | Architecture is stub-swap ready; LLM integration is isolated per service file |
| Next.js 16 / React 19 breaking changes | Build failures, unexpected behaviour | AGENTS.md mandates reading `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before coding |
| State lost on page refresh (Zustand in-memory) | User loses session data | Add Zustand `persist` middleware backed by sessionStorage for production |
| No real authentication | Security risk in production | Demo mode is explicit; add NextAuth / SSO before production deployment |
| DISHA compliance requires data residency | Legal risk | All data must remain on Indian infrastructure; document data flows |
| NABH audit may require additional documentation fields | Compliance gap | Quality module's incident and CAPA workflows provide foundation |

---

## 14. Release Plan

| Phase | Scope | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Alpha** | All 24 portals functional with mock data and AI stubs | Complete (current state) |
| **Beta** | Real authentication, persistent database, LLM integration for top 10 AI services | Q3 2026 |
| **v1.0** | Full LLM integration, DICOM viewer, insurance EDI, NABH certification submission | Q4 2026 |
